# Summary 
I am a student at the Faculty of Applied Mathematics of the Belarusian State University, the specialty Applied computer science. I have been doing programming for two years and during that time I had experience with C ++ / C # and Java. I am attracted by iOS development and Apple's eco-system in general. Earlier I tried to learn Swift and Objective-C languages by myself. During this course, I want to make sure that iOS development is what suits me, develop my programming skills, and learn a lot from people who work in this area.
4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
