# Summary 
I am a student at the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the Belarusian State University, the specialty Applied computer science. I have been doing programming for two years and during that time I had experience with C ++ / C # and Java. I am attracted by iOS development and Apple's eco-system in general. Earlier I tried to learn Swift and Objective-C languages by myself. During this course, I want to make sure that iOS development is what suits me, develop my programming skills, and learn a lot from people who work in this area.

freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
